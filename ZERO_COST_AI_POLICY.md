# Zero-cost AI policy

Enterprise milestone 1, October 10, 2026. `AI_SPENDING_MODE=ZERO_COST_ONLY` is the only accepted setting. There is no owner, CEO, API, budget or routing override to enable paid inference.

`company_os.spending` applies before candidate selection, before financial reservation, and inside both structured and native inference transports. This covers chat, agent messages, meetings, tools, benchmarks, coding, review and repair because they use the same gateway. Ollama embeddings also verify local metadata. Fastembed reads cached CPU-local models; application startup does not download them. Deterministic fixtures are labeled and never represent live AI.

Remote inference is denied. A key, zero registry prices, a subscription, promotional credits or a claim of free quota does not prove provider-enforced zero billing. No remote entitlement verifier exists yet; therefore no remote service is marked VERIFIED_FREE. No potentially billable entitlement probe is made. Catalog discovery remains a distinct, owner-requested, non-inference operation.

Local Ollama candidates require a credential-free HTTP loopback root endpoint, zero registered prices and a non-cloud model identifier. Before every inference the trusted local daemon must return an installed model with a nonempty digest, positive file size, GGUF format and model metadata. Cloud/remote metadata and missing files are rejected. Responses have time and byte bounds, with proxies and redirects disabled. The dashboard stores a digest, configuration fingerprint and five-minute freshness window; stored proof never replaces the per-request check.

The owner controls the local host and daemon. Metadata verification is not cryptographic daemon attestation and cannot protect against a malicious loopback service forging local metadata. Host/daemon integrity and local egress restrictions remain operational requirements. Docker services cannot use a host loopback daemon without an explicitly designed local inference service; arbitrary remote Ollama hosts are deliberately blocked.

When provisioning the local daemon, disable its cloud features with `OLLAMA_NO_CLOUD=1` or its `disable_ollama_cloud` server configuration and verify the restarted daemon's logs, as documented in the [official Ollama FAQ](https://docs.ollama.com/faq#how-do-i-disable-ollama-cloud-features). This workstation has no verified Ollama service; that operational configuration is pending. Manifest field assumptions are grounded in [Ollama's API schema](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openapi.yaml).

No eligible free model means `WAITING_FOR_FREE_PROVIDER`. Assigned employee, exact task revision, review restrictions, context and checkpoint are retained. No external call, reservation or fake answer is generated. An owner notification and append-only audit event record the reason. Configuration changes alone do not resume work. `/workflows/{id}/resume-free` rechecks eligibility; the worker and transport recheck again. Existing uncertain runs still require reconciliation. Expired waits escalate for attention.

Local successful runs record `local_no_provider_charge`. Local electricity/hardware costs are not measured. Historical computed estimates and uncertain charges remain intact. Never describe unknown remote billing as zero.

Production guard regressions are in `tests/test_zero_cost.py`. Older provider protocol/accounting tests explicitly request `contract_inference`, which substitutes deterministic policy decisions and prohibits real HTTP transports. That fixture is test code, not a production setting or live verification.
